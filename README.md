written mainly to avoid manually inputting images and tables into SimFCS (main software for processing the LSM 700 microscope images at the LFD) and into Excel. Code simply opens the images and creates phasor plot. Old version (was made when I first learned python) is a little clunky, but has options for bar plot based on the naming convetion of the images used in the lab.
